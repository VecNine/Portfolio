Hi! I am Wiktor, and I am 17y.o. I am mostly programming in C++ and hoping to become a full-time programmer in the nearest future.

I have been programming for 2 years in C++ and before that, I have been using Scratch (since 4th grade to 8th grade).

Likewise, I am fluent in 2 languages: Polish and English.

My main goal - in relation to programming - is to learn as much as I can and use this knowledge in my dream job.
