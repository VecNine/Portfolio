Hi! I am Wiktor and I am 17y.o. I am mostly programming in C++ and hoping to become a full-time programmer in the nearest future.

Right now I have been programming for 2 years in C++ and before that I have been using Scratch (since 4th grade to 8th grade).

I am fluent in 2 launguages: Polish and English.

My main goal in relation to programming is to learn as much as I can and use this knowledge in job.

You can reach me by Discord: VecNine#2541
